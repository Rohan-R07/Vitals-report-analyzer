## Overview

Every day, millions of blood draws are performed globally, culminating in a printed Complete Blood Count (CBC) report. These documents are saturated with dense clinical shorthand (e.g. MCV, MCH, RDW, PCV) and numerical values. For the average patient, these reports represent an opaque black box.

Vitals provides a patient-first interpreter. It deterministic-parses raw PDF data, falls back to OCR under poor resolution conditions, evaluates parameters via an ensemble Machine Learning model to detect underlying blood pathologies (e.g. specific anemia profiles), and triggers structured Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning loops to produce safe, non-diagnostic guidance regarding diets, hydration, physical fitness, and medical specialist referals.

---

## Problem Statement

The current healthcare system contains several friction points that Vitals is designed to address:
* **The Communication Gap:** Patients leave hospitals or clinics with physical or digital lab reports but zero immediate, understandable explanation of what the results mean.
* **Isolated Parameter Panics:** Typical reports display values next to reference intervals. Seeing a flagged parameter (e.g. low Hemoglobin) frequently leads patients to search generic search engines, resulting in high anxiety or false reassurance.
* **Clinician Burnout & Time Loss:** Up to 30% of standard clinical consultations are scheduled solely to explain routine lab reports that show normal or minor, non-critical variations. This consumes expensive clinical resources and physician hours.
* **Geographic Care Barriers:** Patients in rural regions or small towns often lack immediate, affordable access to hematologists or primary care physicians, causing them to delay necessary dietary or specialist follow-up.
* **Multi-biomarker Intersect Complexity:** Traditional reports check if individual markers are high or low, but fail to explain how markers interact. For example, understanding how a low hemoglobin count combined with low mean corpuscular volume (MCV) indicates microcytic anemia requires complex cross-referencing.

*Healthcare information should be understandable, actionable, and accessible to everyone.*

---

## The Solution

Vitals translates raw clinical diagnostic data into a patient-focused health narrative:

```
[CBC PDF Report] ──> [Deterministic OCR/Regex Parser] ──> [ML Classifier + Ranges Evaluation] ──> [Gemma LLM Reasoning Block] ──> [Structured Patient Care Path]
```

### Explaining the Workflow
1. **Patient Uploads CBC PDF:** Users drop digital or scanned reports into a secure portal.
2. **Deterministic & OCR Extraction:** Reconstructs the character grids, extracting numerical values.
   * *Why:* Solves manual typing errors and digitizes low-resolution paper scans.
3. **Machine Learning Pathology Classification:** Feeds the normalized hematological arrays into a trained Random Forest model.
   * *Why:* Programmatically flags underlying anemia variants (Normal, Iron Deficiency, Folate Deficiency, B12 Deficiency) based on clinical balances rather than isolated parameter limits.
4. **Calculations & reference checks:** Compiles scores based on clinical thresholds.
   * *Why:* Translates clinical metrics into a single, intuitive Physiological Health Score (0-100).
5. **AI Generative Reasoning Loop:** Routes the calculated state array through OpenRouter Gemma-4.
   * *Why:* Transforms raw clinical numbers into reassuring, conversational advice (nutrition, routines, fitness, hydration, and physician recommendations) conforming strictly to structured schemas.
6. **Ecosystem Registry Matching (Future Roadmap):** Recommends verified healthcare specialists and labs nearby.
   * *Why:* Prevents patients from blindly searching online and connects them directly with qualified, verified clinics.

## Why Vitals is Different

Vitals is **not** another Hospital Management System (HMS), booking portal, or open-ended medical chatbot. It is a dedicated **clinical intelligence bridge** representing a unified, multi-tier interpreter:

* **No Open-Ended Chats:** Unlike generic LLM chatbots that hallucinate medical conditions, Vitals uses a feed-forward architectural pipeline where the LLM only structures clinical calculations and predictions derived deterministically from the parser and ML models.
* **Unified Diagnostic Logic:** It is the only platform combining OCR, deterministic regex filters, scikit-learn classifiers, reference calculators, and LLM reasoning into a single light-themed, patient-friendly dashboard.

## Core Features

### Current MVP Implementation
* **Digital PDF & Scanned OCR Ingestion:** Uses `PyMuPDF` text character extraction with direct fallback to `EasyOCR` for low-contrast scans.
* **Footnote Filtering:** Regex filters skip superscript footnote references (e.g. converting `Hematocrit 01 27.3%` safely to `27.3` instead of extracting `01`).
* **Machine Learning Classifier:** Scikit-learn Random Forest model predicting iron deficiency, folate deficiency, vitamin B12 deficiency, hemoglobin-specific anemia, or normal profiles.
* **Calculations Engine:** Computes physiological safety score (0-100), risk tier, abnormal finding tables, and clinical severity.
* **Gemma-4 reasoning Integration:** Connects to OpenRouter to parse states into formatted, markdown-compatible diet lists, fitness routines, and fluid goals.
* **Interactive Lifestyle Dashboard:** Features collapsible biomarker gauges, daily water tracking increments, routine checkbox timelines, and high-fidelity print layouts.
* **Care Partners Preview:** A disabled dashboard section featuring specialist referrals and verified preview partner clinics.

### Future Roadmap Vision
* **Location-Aware Referrals:** Requesting permission to locate nearby clinical specialists in our partner database.
* **Telemedicine booking integrations:** Scheduling appointments directly from the analysis dashboard.
* **Laboratory API Integrations:** Syncing raw values directly from diagnostic center databases, bypassing PDF uploads.

## Business Model & Strategy

Vitals operates under a patient-first healthcare ecosystem philosophy: **Patients should never pay simply to understand their own medical reports.**

### The MVP Model
* **100% Free:** Patients upload reports, receive predictions, and view summaries completely free.
* **No Advertisements:** To preserve patient trust and safety, no clinical pages show third-party ads.

### Long-Term Revenue Streams
The future sustainability of the platform relies on the **Verified Healthcare Partner Network**:
1. **Verified Partner Memberships:** Clinical centers, hospitals, and specialized practitioners pay a recurring membership fee to join the listing registry. In return, they get discoverability, verified clinical badges, and AI-powered referrals.
2. **Referral Commissions:** Partners pay small compliance-approved transaction commissions when patients utilize Vitals to book follow-up consultations.
3. **Premium Subscriptions:** Optional, paid patient subscription tiers containing biomarker history trend charts, AI family vaults, and continuous health monitoring.
4. **Diagnostic Laboratory Affiliate Integrations:** Partner labs pay referral fees to receive automated laboratory orders for follow-up blood count panels recommended in patient lifestyle summaries.
